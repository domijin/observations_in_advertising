When ads match the theme and mood, users’ minds are less resistant to influence, akin to social engineering in cybersecurity. <br> - **Example:** **Hollywood** has pioneered this approach, shaping culture and values by capturing and prioritizing attention with curated storytelling. <br> **In-situ advertising with CTV** has the potential to surpass traditional poster ads and TV commercials due to its dynamic and attributable nature. <br> **Voice ads** leverage emotion-rich, less attention-invasive qualities. <br> - **Example:** The success of Google’s NotebookML podcasting feature highlights voice ads' potential. <br> **Shift from correlation to causality in context modeling:** Emerging systems, like TikTok’s real-time recommendation engine, leverage exploratory models to extract behavioral patterns, enhancing upper-stage relevance modeling and attribution.|



Performance advertising is a vast and ever-evolving domain, far too complex to be fully captured within the confines of a single table or essay. 

My aim here is to distill key signals and make educated guesses about future trends, but this effort is merely the starting point. I hope this piece serves as thought-provoking material for colleagues and domain experts to comment on, debate, or expand upon. 

To encourage collaboration, I have published this work on Medium for easier feedback and discussion. For those motivated to amend, extend, or pivot the content, I’ve also created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/domijin/observations_in_advertising) to make this a living repository of ideas, insights, and practices.

### Highlights of the Potential Paradigm Shift

As a closing to this section, I’d like to highlight four key areas where the most impactful changes in performance advertising are taking shape:

1. Sensing:
    - Deep sensing enabled by extensive attribution to build long and dense contextual understanding (though still far from the complexity of real life).
    - Algorithm-friendly product designs that facilitate the collection of more granular and actionable data.
    - Ambient data collection techniques that gather subtle and contextual insights.
2. Display:
    - Advances in affective computing, enabling emotionally resonant and impactful ad interactions.
    - Multi-channel content delivery that ensures seamless engagement across diverse platforms.
3. From Surveillance to Inception Capitalism:
    - Spontaneous content display that seamlessly integrates ads into everyday user experiences.
    - Emerging causal modeling approaches that move beyond simple correlation, leveraging online learning for deeper contextual understanding.
4. Dynamic Ad Content Generation:
    - Dynamic, context-aware ad creation powered by generative AI models.
    - A new gig economy driven by crowdsourcing ad production, enabling greater creativity and scalability in ad creation.


> Due to space constraints, I have not elaborated on the details of Dynamic Ad Content Generation—a trend widely regarded as straightforward to anticipate given the rise of generative AI. Similarly, I’ve omitted my executive insights, which could serve as references for teams evaluating similar opportunities. For those interested, feel free to reach out directly for further discussion.

I also realize that sharing my background might help readers better contextualize and evaluate the philosophical thinking and industry observations presented here.

### My Relevant Background

By way of introduction:

- At **Miles**, I helped build a recommendation engine that extracted and monetized context from mobility data, such as travel patterns and GPS-based location histories. We used offline insights to power affiliate marketing for local businesses.
- At **Thumbtack**, I worked on pricing strategies for a local home services marketplace. My work included exploring generative AI for request flows and organic content creation, advocating for an educational and inspirational content platform to bridge the information gap between users and professionals, improve market efficiency, and generate organic traffic.
- At **AppLovin**, I served as the first data scientist in the research scientist team, focusing on product analytics, model performance evaluation, and partnership insights.

This diverse experience across recommendation systems, generative AI, and advertising analytics shapes my perspective on the trends and shifts outlined in this essay.


## Part III: The Growth Trap

As paradigm shifts in advertising unfold, the economics of scaling laws present a critical challenge. While increased data collection and deeper contextual insights promise significant improvements in model performance, the cost of achieving these gains grows exponentially. The allure of achieving a "God's perspective" through near-perfect models is undeniable, but it comes at a steep price—not only in terms of financial cost but also in ethical and privacy considerations.


### Economics of The Scaling Law

The unsustainable growth of data per user creates diminishing returns on model performance. Even with the sophisticated setups imagined in science fiction like Inception, the marginal improvement in predictions may fail to justify the enormous costs of training and maintaining such models.

While technological advancements expand the possibilities of data-driven advertising, they also force us to confront a fundamental question: where do we draw the line between utility and intrusion?

### The Demand-Driven Market's Trap
We live in an era dominated by demand-driven economies, where marketing is the core engine of modern capitalism. Since the Great Depression, the economic model has evolved to amplify demand, enabling enterprises to grow and capital to accumulate. This system thrives on expanding and deepening markets, using marketing as the vehicle to connect production with consumer needs.

**The Double-Edged Sword of Marketing:**

When products are good, marketing enhances lives by connecting users with solutions that improve their quality of life. But when products fall short, excessive marketing can distort market dynamics, prioritizing visibility over value. This leads to a paradox where advertising success can overshadow the importance of product innovation, particularly in categories with low technological barriers and high substitutability.

**Digital Amplification:**

In the digital era, where information is abundant but attention is limited, effective distribution of information becomes the cornerstone of success. However, this demand-driven focus often leads to **market blindness**, where the relentless pursuit of growth ignores long-term sustainability and value creation.

### The Hidden Costs of Demand-Driven Capitalism
While the demand-driven economy has powered modern growth, it comes with significant risks:

1. Consumer Fatigue: Excessive advertising and information overload contribute to user disengagement.
2. Regulation Risks: The ethical and privacy concerns surrounding data usage invite regulatory scrutiny, potentially disrupting business models.
3. Competitive Pressure: In fast-moving markets, competitors rapidly copy successful strategies, eroding the initial advantage.

At its core, the current capitalist has its flaw, akin to a ticking time bomb. Its simplicity and power drive short-term gains but may fail to address humanity’s critical challenges, such as sustainable growth and ethical progress.

### Challenge and Opportunities

The pitfalls of an economy dominated by material growth and competition have led to a **monolithic** form of progress, a decrease in diversity and richness of experiences, and an increasingly fragile market structure.

- **Erosion of Mental Well-being**: The pursuit of instant gratification in entertainment, consumption, and emotional engagement leaves no room for deep, meaningful development.

- **Hierarchy of Needs**: People are seeking more than just fulfillment of basic needs; they want emotional satisfaction and personalized experiences. This personalization requires building sufficient personal context to meet users' true interests and aspirations.

- **Future of Education**: Education must be adaptive and exploratory, promoting lifelong learning. Products that reinforce this kind of adaptive learning will grow with their users.

## Potential Path Forward

### A Glimpse into the Future

I envision a world where **enlightenment through education** plays a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable society. By **promoting self-awareness**, **empowering** people to explore externally, and reflecting internally, individuals would achieve **self-realization and self-actualization**. Such a society would transcend material desires and embrace a philosophical journey—one where **mutual enlightenment and collaborative practices** allow individuals to pursue their **intrinsic value and self-actualization** through **peer learning and social interaction.**


I see a future where technology is used to [**empower people to collaborate better**](https://domijin.github.io/pages/about-me.html): the old [manifesto](https://domijin.github.io/manifesto.html) and [initiative](https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth).

- From **Enlightenment to Illumination**: Moving society from basic enlightenment to a state where individual potential is fully ignited.
- A future where production matches personalized needs and **communal creativity** thrives.

This essay merely scratches the surface of my reflections on the modern economy, marketing-driven capitalism, and its hidden implications. These challenges—rooted in demand-driven logic—have shaped my journey in learning and seeking solutions. In future writings, I plan to share more insights into these systemic flaws, possible remedies, and how humanity can chart a better path forward. Stay tuned for a deeper dive.

I’ve found what feels like the highest mountain: liberating humanity from the demand-driven market powered by surveillance capitalism and recalibrating societal priorities by breaking the power imbalances created by information asymmetry. But I know this peak is only the beginning.

Beyond this summit lie greater challenges and higher mountains, waiting for humanity to ascend. The view from each peak will inspire new visions for the future, illuminating paths we never imagined. To strive for these heights, and to inspire others to do the same, is a mission worth dedicating a lifetime to—and perhaps even dying for.
