| **Observation**                                                                                | **Hypothesis**                                                                             | **Implications**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| AppLovin validated that **gamers are also interested in e-commerce ads.**                     | Users’ interests are diverse and multifaceted. <br> This **versatility** in behavior suggests that **traditional** genre-based **segmentation** is overly **restrictive**.                                           | Advertisers can blend ad genres to appeal to a wider range of user interests. <br> - **Example:** Content platforms (e.g., Amazon Prime Video) showing gaming ads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| AppLovin demonstrated that **game user data** can be effectively applied to **e-commerce ad delivery models.** | The underlying user mindset **model** is **adaptable** across **diverse** advertising **verticals**.       | The full potential of user data remains untapped by existing models. <br> - **Example:** The super app trend in China illustrates the scaling effect, where diminishing incremental investments yield compounding returns in new verticals.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1. AppLovin uses gaming data to model e-commerce interest. <br> 2. Startups like Miles leverage mobility data for local service affiliate marketing. <br> 3. TikTok delivers the best recommendation engine. | **Data collection** is a key **competitive edge** in performance advertising. <br> The **scaling law still holds**, as demonstrated since the deep learning revolution: **performance (e.g., ad relevancy) scales with** the quality, granularity, dimensionality, and modality of **data**.                    |  **Algorithm-friendly product design** will become more prevalent to efficiently collect high-quality data. <br> - **Example:** Allowing users to swipe for new ads instead of forcing them to skip after 15 seconds of irrelevant content provides positive and negative signals to models. <br> **Increased online-offline integration** will emerge. <br> - **Example:** Offline signals, such as frequent visits to specific locations, enhance the relevance of online ads (e.g., Miles). <br> **LLMs unlock new data modalities & affective computing**, including emotional cues and uncharted dimensions through black-box embeddings extracted from LLMs. |
| 1. **"Free"** services are ubiquitous, with **privacy** becoming the primary **commodity**. <br> 2. Semiconductor **sensors** (e.g., gyroscope, LiDAR, touchscreens, biometric sensors, security cameras) experience exponential growth. <br> 3. Data and privacy **regulations** struggle to keep pace. | The boom of **ambient data collection** and **sophisticated attribution** systems thrives under **surveillance capitalism**. <br> **Products are more addictive** than ever, with experts **psychologically engineering** engagement. <br> **Attention** drives **engagement**, and engagement fuels the **economy**. | Advertisers can collect attributed data without explicit user awareness. <br> **Users underestimate** the depth and breadth of **privacy erosion** in **data access consent**, fueling a data "gold rush." <br> - **Examples:** GPS data can infer children, pets, income, and occupation; browsing history reveals gender, sexual orientation, social status, and mental health, etc. <br> **Cross-channel attribution** enables **holistic** user profiling through **cross-referencing** diverse data points, akin to **multi-passenger astronomy.** <br> **Gamification, nudge theory, network effects, and "human"-centric designs** are Swiss Army knives for product gurus and growth hackers. |
| 1. Walmart Connect uses kiosks to show ads at checkout. <br> 2. Unity places ad units within game environments. <br> 3. Merchants are integrating ads into storefront connected TVs. | The rise of **“spontaneous” content display** signals a potential **paradigm shift** toward **inception capitalism**, where users' minds are **less guarded** against non-primary content displays. | **Expansion of ad placements:** AR/VR and voice AI will create more opportunities for publishers to inject ads. When ads match the theme and mood, users’ minds are less resistant to influence, akin to social engineering in cybersecurity. <br> - **Example:** **Hollywood** has pioneered this approach, shaping culture and values by capturing and prioritizing attention with curated storytelling. <br> **In-situ advertising with CTV** has the potential to surpass traditional poster ads and TV commercials due to its dynamic and attributable nature. <br> **Voice ads** leverage emotion-rich, less attention-invasive qualities. <br> - **Example:** The success of Google’s NotebookML podcasting feature highlights voice ads' potential. <br> **Shift from correlation to causality in context modeling:** Emerging systems, like TikTok’s real-time recommendation engine, leverage exploratory models to extract behavioral patterns, enhancing upper-stage relevance modeling and attribution.|
