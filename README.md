## Part II: Observations in the Performance Advertising Industry 

> Search, recommendation, and advertising are undoubtedly the crown jewels of the information technology domain. They exemplify remarkable efficiency and effectiveness, standing as awe-inspiring marvels of engineering and technological innovation. Performance advertising happens to be where I got a chance to take a front-row seat to shape the following realizations.

| **Observation**                                                                                | **Hypothesis**                                                                             | **Implications**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| AppLovin validated that **gamers are also interested in e-commerce ads.**                     | Users’ interests are diverse and multifaceted. <br> This **versatility** in behavior suggests that **traditional** genre-based **segmentation** is overly **restrictive**.                                           | Advertisers can blend ad genres to appeal to a wider range of user interests. <br> - **Example:** Content platforms (e.g., Amazon Prime Video) showing gaming ads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| AppLovin demonstrated that **game user data** can be effectively applied to **e-commerce ad delivery models.** | The underlying user mindset **model** is **adaptable** across **diverse** advertising **verticals**.       | The full potential of user data remains untapped by existing models. <br> - **Example:** The super app trend in China illustrates the scaling effect, where diminishing incremental investments yield compounding returns in new verticals.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1. AppLovin uses gaming data to model e-commerce interest. <br> 2. Startups like Miles leverage mobility data for local service affiliate marketing. <br> 3. TikTok delivers the best recommendation engine. | **Data collection** is a key **competitive edge** in performance advertising. <br> The **scaling law still holds**, as demonstrated since the deep learning revolution: **performance (e.g., ad relevancy) scales with** the quality, granularity, dimensionality, and modality of **data**.                    |  **Algorithm-friendly product design** will become more prevalent to efficiently collect high-quality data. <br> - **Example:** Allowing users to swipe for new ads instead of forcing them to skip after 15 seconds of irrelevant content provides positive and negative signals to models. <br> **Increased online-offline integration** will emerge. <br> - **Example:** Offline signals, such as frequent visits to specific locations, enhance the relevance of online ads (e.g., Miles). <br> **LLMs unlock new data modalities & affective computing**, including emotional cues and uncharted dimensions through black-box embeddings extracted from LLMs. |
| 1. **"Free"** services are ubiquitous, with **privacy** becoming the primary **commodity**. <br> 2. Semiconductor **sensors** (e.g., gyroscope, LiDAR, touchscreens, biometric sensors, security cameras) experience exponential growth. <br> 3. Data and privacy **regulations** struggle to keep pace. | The boom of **ambient data collection** and **sophisticated attribution** systems thrives under **surveillance capitalism**. <br> **Products are more addictive** than ever, with experts **psychologically engineering** engagement. <br> **Attention** drives **engagement**, and engagement fuels the **economy**. | Advertisers can collect attributed data without explicit user awareness. <br> **Users underestimate** the depth and breadth of **privacy erosion** in **data access consent**, fueling a data "gold rush." <br> - **Examples:** GPS data can infer children, pets, income, and occupation; browsing history reveals gender, sexual orientation, social status, and mental health, etc. <br> **Cross-channel attribution** enables **holistic** user profiling through **cross-referencing** diverse data points, akin to **multi-passenger astronomy.** <br> **Gamification, nudge theory, network effects, and "human"-centric designs** are Swiss Army knives for product gurus and growth hackers. |
| 1. Walmart Connect uses kiosks to show ads at checkout. <br> 2. Unity places ad units within game environments. <br> 3. Merchants are integrating ads into storefront connected TVs. | The rise of **“spontaneous” content display** signals a potential **paradigm shift** toward **inception capitalism**, where users' minds are **less guarded** against non-primary content displays. | **Expansion of ad placements:** AR/VR and voice AI will create more opportunities for publishers to inject ads. When ads match the theme and mood, users’ minds are less resistant to influence, akin to social engineering in cybersecurity. <br> - **Example:** **Hollywood** has pioneered this approach, shaping culture and values by capturing and prioritizing attention with curated storytelling. <br> **In-situ advertising with CTV** has the potential to surpass traditional poster ads and TV commercials due to its dynamic and attributable nature. <br> **Voice ads** leverage emotion-rich, less attention-invasive qualities. <br> - **Example:** The success of Google’s NotebookML podcasting feature highlights voice ads' potential. <br> **Shift from correlation to causality in context modeling:** Emerging systems, like TikTok’s real-time recommendation engine, leverage exploratory models to extract behavioral patterns, enhancing upper-stage relevance modeling and attribution.|



Performance advertising is a vast and ever-evolving domain, far too complex to be fully captured within the confines of a single table or essay. 

My aim here is to distill key signals and make educated guesses about future trends, but this effort is merely the starting point. I hope this piece serves as thought-provoking material for colleagues and domain experts to comment on, debate, or expand upon. 

To encourage collaboration, I have published this work on Medium for easier feedback and discussion. For those motivated to amend, extend, or pivot the content, I’ve also created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/domijin/observations_in_advertising) to make this a living repository of ideas, insights, and practices.

### Highlights of the Potential Paradigm Shift

As a closing to this section, I’d like to highlight four key areas where the most impactful changes in performance advertising are taking shape:

1. Sensing:
    - Deep sensing enabled by extensive attribution to build long and dense contextual understanding (though still far from the complexity of real life).
    - Algorithm-friendly product designs that facilitate the collection of more granular and actionable data.
    - Ambient data collection techniques that gather subtle and contextual insights.
2. Display:
    - Advances in affective computing, enabling emotionally resonant and impactful ad interactions.
    - Multi-channel content delivery that ensures seamless engagement across diverse platforms.
3. From Surveillance to Inception Capitalism:
    - Spontaneous content display that seamlessly integrates ads into everyday user experiences.
    - Emerging causal modeling approaches that move beyond simple correlation, leveraging online learning for deeper contextual understanding.
4. Dynamic Ad Content Generation:
    - Dynamic, context-aware ad creation powered by generative AI models.
    - A new gig economy driven by crowdsourcing ad production, enabling greater creativity and scalability in ad creation.


> Due to space constraints, I have not elaborated on the details of Dynamic Ad Content Generation—a trend widely regarded as straightforward to anticipate given the rise of generative AI. Similarly, I’ve omitted my executive insights, which could serve as references for teams evaluating similar opportunities. For those interested, feel free to reach out directly for further discussion.

I also realize that sharing my background might help readers better contextualize and evaluate the philosophical thinking and industry observations presented here.

### My Relevance to the Industry

By way of introduction:

- At **Miles**, I helped build a recommendation engine that extracted and monetized context from mobility data, such as travel patterns and GPS-based location histories. We used offline insights to power affiliate marketing for local businesses.
- At **Thumbtack**, I worked on pricing strategies for a local home services marketplace. My work included exploring generative AI for request flows and organic content creation, advocating for an educational and inspirational content platform to bridge the information gap between users and professionals, improve market efficiency, and generate organic traffic.
- At **AppLovin**, I served as the first data scientist in the research scientist team, focusing on product analytics, model performance evaluation, and partnership insights.

This diverse experience across recommendation systems, generative AI, and advertising analytics shapes my perspective on the trends and shifts outlined in this essay.
